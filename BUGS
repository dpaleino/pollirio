Reporting bugs in pollirio
==========================

To manage bugreports, we use Bugs-Everywhere, a bugtracker built on 
distributed revision control. On Debian systems, just apt-get install 
it.

The idea is to package the bug information with the source code, so that 
bugs can be marked "fixed" in the branches/commits that fix them. So, 
instead of numbers, bugs have ids, much like git revision hashes.

To create bugs, use:

  $ be new "DESCRIPTION"

To comment on bugs, you can can use:

  $ be comment BUG_ID

You can see current bugs with

  $ be list

To close a bug, use

  $ be close BUG_ID

and be sure to commit the .be/ directory together with the code fixing 
the bug.

For more commands, see "be help".
